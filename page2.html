            <center>What is Web Design?</center><br>
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are
            displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the
            user experience aspects of website development rather
            than software development. Web design used to be
            focused on designing websites for desktop browsers;
            however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
            tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly
            important.
