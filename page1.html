        <center>What is Web Design?</center><br>
        Web design refers to the design of websites that are
        displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the
        user experience aspects of website development rather
        than software development. Web design used to be
        focused on designing websites for desktop browsers;
        however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
        tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly
        important.
